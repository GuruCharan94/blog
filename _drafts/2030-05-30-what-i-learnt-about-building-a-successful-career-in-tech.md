This month I complete FIVE YEARS as a Software Developer. Here is a collection of some of the top lessons in no specific order that I learned about building a successful career as a developer.

## 1. OK to Negotiate

- Your colleagues negotiated. May be benefits. But they negotiated.
- It is not a conflict. It is a discussion. You'd negotiate on house, on a car. Negotiate on the value of your skills and time as well.

## 2. "It's not about money"

- You owe it to yourself. Salary Compression.
- They are trying to keep you down.
- Maslow hierarchy. Money gives you options.

## 3. Your Manager is not your family

- aaa
- aaa
- sss

## 4. HR is not your friend

## 7. Imposter Syndrome is Real

## 8. Interviews are broken

- Apply if you match 50% of the skills.
- you cannot agile, devops, kubernetes your way around a crappy culture.
- Here is a role I vacated.

## 5. Do you having a Mentor / Sponsor ?

## 10. Coding for Work vs Coding for fun


- Three things if you want to be successful
  - Skills
  - Reputation
  - Network
