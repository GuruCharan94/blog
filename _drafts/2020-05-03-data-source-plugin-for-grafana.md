## What are Grafana Plugins

Grafana offers you a wide range of visualizations and data sources. If you need a special visualization type or a need to pull in data from a source that is not supported out of the box, you can extend Grafana by building plugins.

Grafana supports three types of plugins

1. Panels - A new visualization type such as map, pie-charts etc.

2. Data sources Plugins - Add support to visualize a new database using a panel.

3. Apps = Panel + Data Source Plugins to provide a cohesive experience.
