Hi, I am Gurucharan from Bangalore, India. I am a Software Engineer currently working on the Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers team at ABB focusing specifically on their cloud efforts. I can do .NET, Azure and Azure Devops.

Outside of work, I co-chair the Azure User Group in Bangalore, I am a member of the .NET Foundation and quickly becoming an all-round community buff.

## My Story

It was mid 2015 when I began my career as a .NET developer building web applications with ASP.NET MVC. My early years were a great  experience where I understood the importance of engineering clean, loosely coupled applications rather than ones that merely got the job done. I had built up enough expertise to become a Microsoft Certified Specialist in ASP.NET MVC and Web development.

The .NET docs always had a **hey, you can do this with Microsoft Azure too** and I followed suit by signing up for Azure. I began to appreciate the benefits of the cloud and I stumbled upon Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), now Azure DevOps. The idea of the cloud, DevOps & Continuous Delivery was exciting and I never looked back. I think my .NET skills are complemented well by my Azure knowledge and made me well-balanced overall.

By early 2018, I changed jobs and was just plain lucky to have a [colleague](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasf/) who runs the Bangalore Azure User Group. This was the start of me spending time with the software community. What started as me helping around with meetup logistics quickly ended with me becoming a part of the core-organizers of the community and a regular speaker.

My first talk was him basically convincing me that my idea / voice was good enough & deserves to be heard. It was the stuff of nightmares. My imposter syndrome just cranked up to level 12. Who am I to tell ~100 people how to do something on Azure ? But I went through with this anyway, gave a decent (but not my best) talk and several people did give me positive feedback after the talk. In fact,one member of the audience even asked me if I can do this talk for his user group. I did that as well, then one thing led to the other, and then some more and eventually I got better at it and the experience has been incredibly rewarding. I made new friends, met people with similar interests, demonstrated my knowledge and helped people.

My speaking engagements and other community contributions have led to me becoming a voting member of the .NET foundation. I want to see what I can do there.
