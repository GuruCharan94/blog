## Short Version

Hi, I am Gurucharan from Bangalore, India. I am a Software Engineer and I work in the interesting space where .NET, Azure & Azure DevOps meet and dance. On some days I am Dev, on other days I am Ops and frequently many things in between.

Outside of work, I am a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org), co-chair the [Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/) in Bangalore, speak, blog and have more side-projects than I should.

## Long Version

It was mid 2015 when I began my career as a .NET developer at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) building web applications with C#, ASP.NET MVC, Web API and Entity Framework. I did some amount of front-end work with HTML, CSS and Javascript as well. I guess I can call that "full-stack" development but I was mostly having fun with .NET. My early years were a great experience where I understood the importance of writing good code rather than the ones that merely got the job done. I had built up enough expertise to become a [Microsoft Certified Specialist in ASP.NET MVC and Web development](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f1ac7afe-508a-4fff-ab78-f4eba3010d03/public_url).

The .NET docs always had a **hey, you can do this with Microsoft Azure too** and I followed suit by signing up for Azure. I began to appreciate the benefits of the cloud and I stumbled upon Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), now Azure DevOps. The idea of the cloud, DevOps & Continuous Delivery was exciting and I never looked back. My .NET skills were complemented well by my Azure knowledge and I think made me well-balanced overall.

By early 2018, I joined ABB to work on their Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform and then moved to the [Electric Vehicle (EV) Chargers team](https://new.abb.com/abb-ability/transport/electric-vehicles) building sustainable E-Mobility solutions. I work on Azure & Azure DevOps and focus on making [our systems operable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/design-for-operations) and best in class for the EV industry and beyond. It is a fantastic experience working with a distributed team. I work remotely from the offices in Bangalore, India.

### Community Participation

It was plain luck that [my colleague](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasf/) was involved with the Bangalore Azure User Group. I've always wanted to go to those meetups and learn new things and this was great way to get started. What started as me helping around with meetup logistics quickly ended with me becoming a regular speaker and a part of the organizers.

My first talk was basically him convincing (read: forcing) me to give a talk on [Secure DevOps Kit for Azure](https://azsk.azurewebsites.net). My imposter syndrome cranked up to level 12. Who am I to tell ~100 people how to do security on Azure ? But I went through with this anyway and several people gave me positive feedback after the talk. One member of the audience asked me if I can do this talk at a different event. I did that, then one thing led to the other, and before I realized I was a regular public speaker. It is a great way to make new friends, meet people with similar interests, showcase my expertise and thus far the experience has been incredibly rewarding.

My speaking engagements and other community contributions have led to me becoming a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org). I am looking forward to helping [strengthen the future of the .NET ecosystem](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/OpenSourceIsAThanklessJobWeDoItAnyway.aspx) as part of the membership, meetups and outreach Action Groups.
