The Pub-Sub is a simple newsletter. I break it down to 3 points.

1. I PUBLISH interesting updates on Azure, .NET, Container Technologies and JavaScript as a newsletter twice a month.

2. If you like latest announcements, interesting blog posts and tutorials delivered straight to your inbox, you SUBSCRIBE to this newsletter.

3. Your email will not be used for any purpose other than this newsletter. You can unsubscribe at anytime and your email gets deleted automatically.

Are you convinced ? Great !! Subscribe using the form below.

Not quite ? Take a look at previous editions. It might change your mind.
